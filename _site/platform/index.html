      <h2>Climate Change</h2>
      <p>Climate change has reached global crisis levels. This isn't breaking news: the <a target="_blank" href="https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/#*">scientific community has developed a strong consensus</a> on this topic. Beyond global catastrophe, taking steps to transition our economy toward increased renewable energy production is more sustainable&mdash;put simply, renewables are becoming cheaper, and over the next couple of decades they'll begin to wholesale replace the use of fossil fuels; it's better to phase fossil fuels out on a timeline that works for our economy rather than to wait until the market eliminates jobs on its own with no retraining programs or government assistance to smooth the process.</p>
      <p>To this end, our platform includes the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Create job retraining programs</b> to keep our economy strong as we anticipate a global transition away from fossil fuels</li>
        <li><b>Bolster government incentives</b> for renewable energy use to expand access to low-income communities and shift an inevitable energy revolution to a timeline more hospitable to our survival as a species</li>
        <li><b>Increase investiment in research</b> to discover new forms of low-carbon energy and diversify our energy portfolio, and to develop carbon-scrubbing technologies</li>
        <li><b>Emphasize protection</b> of environmental assets around the globe</li>
        <li><b>Push for progressive, multilateral treaties with developing economies</b> to steer development towards renewable energy sources</li>
        <li><b>Fight for environmental justice</b> for low-income communities around the planet disproportionately affected by a catastrophe they did not create</li>
      </ul>

  <section class="light-allblue" id="guns">
    <div class="center">
      <h2>Gun Control</h2>
      <p><a target="_blank" href="/resources/cdc_78283_DS1.pdf">Gun violence is the third-leading cause of deaths</a> among U.S. children and teenagers and the second-leading cause of injuries. Though mass shootings account for a small portion of total deaths, nevertheless in 2019 alone they accounted for 1,907 people killed or wounded across 409 mass shootings. That's more than one mass shooting per day. It doesn't have to be this way.</p>
      <p>There are constitutional actions we can take to lower rates of gun deaths and make our country safer. YouPAC stands behind <a target="_blank" href="https://marchforourlives.com/peace-plan/">March For Our Lives' <b>Peace Plan</b></a>, which we consider a bold, progressive and meaningful docket of policies. In particular, we plan to fight for the following policy proposals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Push for universal background checks, increased permit requirements, expanded "may-issue" laws, and bolstered restrictions on gun ownership</b>, which <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bu.edu/articles/2019/state-gun-laws-that-reduce-gun-deaths/">research shows</a> significantly reduce gun deaths.</li>
        <li><b>Create an independent body to better study and make recommendations on gun reform</b>, with sufficient funding to see through research and policy creation.</li>
      </ul>

  <section class="light-darkblue" id="loans">
    <div class="center">
      <h2>Student Loans</h2>
      <p>Federal student loans are a textbook example of corruption and policy failure on a massive scale. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2019/02/25/student-loan-debt-statistics-2019/#541f78e3133f">Student loan statistics </a> are staggering. There are currently 45 million student borrowers sharing a collective burden of <b>$1.5 trillion</b>, with an average balance of $28,650. For many first-time borrowers, these numbers are too large even to have meaning. Existing policies exploit a vulnerable population to line the pocketbooks of private loan providers with little oversight or compassion for the situations we're placing student borrowers in. If we set the expectation that four-year college is a new standard form of education and allow students, many of whom aren't even adults, to agree to insurmountable amounts of debt, we should make it as easy and flexible as possible for them to pay those loans back.</p>
      <p>Pursuant to this goal, YouPAC will advocate the following policies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Revitalize the Department of Education or create a new body</b> to add oversight to the student loan process. This body should be responsible for the production of frequent transparency reports and act as a watchdog both for public and private actors involved in the student lending business. It should also develop standard, mandatory practices and guidelines loan providers must follow which will make the lending process easier and less predatory for borrowers</li>
        <li><b>Allow borrowers to choose their loan provider</b>, instilling competition into what has devolved into a corrosive marketplace</li>
        <li><b>Allow borrwers to refinance their student loans</b> to reduce monthly payments or to take advantage of lower interest rates</li>
        <li><b>Create new loan forgiveness programs</b> and other safety nets built into the system to protect student borrowers from future financial harm</li>

      </ul>
