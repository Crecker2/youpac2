  <h2 class="transparency">Mission, Vision, Values</h2>
  <p>We're guided by a simple, powerful idea: those affected by life-altering policy decisions should have a seat at the table.</p>

    <h2>Our mission</h2>
    <p>YouPAC's central goal is to advocate the issues of young people around the country. In a time when our economic future, our environmental security, our very lives are being legislated away, we cannot stand by and wait our turn. YouPAC exists because young people are outvoiced by industry lobbies and representatives who can negotiate away our futures without facing significant political consequences. The only way to change this system that is to speak up.</p>
    <p>All around the country, America's youth are organizing&mdash;from <a href="https://marchforourlives.com/">March for our Lives</a> to the <a href="https://globalclimatestrike.net/">September 2019 Climate Strikes</a>. But the inaction in Washington and local legislatures has shown that this isn't enough. YouPAC invokes traditional tactics&mdash;fundraising, organizing, and independent advocacy&mdash;to hit home an agenda that protects our futures and fights for change our generation desperately needs.</p>

    <h2>Our vision for the future</h2>
    <p>A lack of advocacy for youth issues has led to a categorical deprioritization of policies which could make our lives and futures more secure. We're not starting small, but we're starting specific: we want to reduce gun deaths in the United States, end predatory student loan practices endorsed by the federal government, and work towards a greener future for us and our children.</p>
    <p>By parrying corporate lobbies and other political action committees, we can inject the voices of young people into our political process and gain a seat at the table.</p>

    <h2>Our values</h2>
    <p>As an organization, we are only as strong as the coalition we build; as individuals, we are only guided in the right direction by our values if we follow them. We stand firmly by the following principles and vow to keep them in our minds and in our hearts in every decision we make.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>We will be the change we wish to see</b>. Today's political climate is toxic. We recognize that we won't get anywhere by contributing to the burning of bridges or the widening of ditches.</li>
      <li><b>We embrace the diversity of our coalition</b>. Racism and prejudice aren't just the flagrant, abhorrent, and highly visible acts we see embedded in our political discourse today. To exclude or forget people can be just as damaging. As an organization we are committed to the inclusion of marginalized voices in our policymaking and advocacy.</li>
      <li><b>We are beholden to our donors and community members</b>. We're doing this on behalf of the people who support us. We'll find ways to include members of our community on crucial decisions that govern how we run YouPAC.</li>
      <li><b>We will be transparent and honest</b>. We understand that as a political action committee and a crowd-funded organization, we have a responsibility to live up to the trust vested in us. <a href="/transparency">Click here</a> for more information about our transparency policy.</li>
